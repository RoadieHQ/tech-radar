# tech-radar
Example Tech Radar data taken from the tech radar plugin sample data. There are three top level concepts:
* Entries: Technologies you wish to place on your radar
* Quadrants: Broad catagories that entries fit into e.g. Languages, Platforms, Techniques, Tools.
* Rings: Represent a scale by which you compare entries. E.g. Adopt, Trial, Assess, Hold

The data will be parsed as a [TechRadarLoaderResponse](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/a9e869a6b550103b5a0e5799fb895cd63c9acc0b/plugins/tech-radar/src/api.ts#L54)
